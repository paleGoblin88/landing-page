To complete this project, I will need to create an entire web page from a design that will be provided to me. The design will come in the form of two images, one of which will show the complete website, while the other will provide some details about the fonts and colors that were used.

I may encounter some small details that were not covered in the lessons, but I can handle them by searching for solutions on Google. It is not necessary to achieve a pixel-perfect replica of the design, but I should aim to get the various elements in their correct positions relative to one another. I should also not get bogged down in the exact margin measurements, and instead focus on the overall layout and design.

I should feel free to substitute the provided dummy content with my own. This will make the page more personal and unique. I can insert actual images in the placeholders, and play with the colors and fonts a bit too.

Overall, this project is a great opportunity to practice and apply the skills I have learned. By completing this project, I will gain more confidence in my web development abilities and improve my skills.To complete this project, I will need to create an entire web page from a design that will be provided to me.
